# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game allows the player to choose a difficulty level and then guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:**
   - Run the Python script.
   - When prompted, press 'S' to start the game.

2. **Choose Difficulty Level:**
   - Easy (Press 'E'): Number range 0-50, 3 attempts
   - Medium (Press 'M'): Number range 0-200, 5 attempts
   - Hard (Press 'H'): Number range 0-500, 8 attempts

3. **Guess the Number:**
   - Enter your guess when prompted.
   - The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

4. **Winning and Losing:**
   - If you guess the number correctly within the allowed attempts, you win.
   - If you use up all your attempts without guessing correctly, the game reveals the correct number.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Save the Python script in a `.ipynb` file (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script with the command:



## Future Enhancements

- Add an option to play again without restarting the script.
- Handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.
- Provide hints when guesses are close to the correct number.
